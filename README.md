# Functionality
* In this iteration, we created a prototype android app. You can select a character in our Character Creation fragment, assign attribute points and explore our 10x10 map. If within proximity of an enemy, you enter can enter combat and gain XP. You can repeatedly play the game as many times as you'd like.
* Limitations: We are going to create a better way to interact with the map. In future iterations, we will have a clickable map instead of buttons. We intend to implement a player's inventory, character sheet and equipment slots in future implementations. Their buttons currently are not interactive and invisible. 
# Usage Instructions
1) Select a Caste and Race in our Character Creation Fragment
2) Assign 4 attribute points and hit "ENTER CHOICES" button to continue to explore fragment.
3) In the explore fragment, you are able to move around on the map and regenerate health with the 4 directional buttons (U(p), D(own), L(eft), R(ight)).
4) When you encounter an enemy, click the "FIGHT" button 
5) you have now entered combat. if you die, you are able to restart the game. Otherwise you can continue to explore the map and fight enemies.
