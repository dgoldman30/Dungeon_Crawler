# Functionality

In our final iteration, we improved our implementation of the game systems and polished the UI style.
We added an interactive inventory to equip weapons, armor, and potions. There is a clickable map to
enable movement. When in combat, the user has the option between attacking, blocking, or drinking their
currently equipped potion.

# Usage Instructions
1) Select a race, caste, and assign your attributes in character creation.
2) Begin exploring the dungeons by clicking in the direction you want to move.
3) Enter combat by moving adjacent to an enemy. Upon defeating all the enemies on the floor, progress
to the next level via the stairs.
4) Enemies will drop loot that you can equip in your inventory screen, accessed by the menu button on
the left of the screen.
5) Gain XP and keep progressing as far as you can go!
6) Once you've been killed, enter a name to save your character to the leaderboards.

# Testing
Tests were run using the Pixel 5 API 30 emulator.
